This is a goal visualizer. Deployment at http://goal-visualizer.herokuapp.com




# TODO: 


some way to deprecate goals (requires display rewrite i think)
reset selection after inputting progress
github and heroku links



low priority: 

popover: remove some descriptive text
add print to each api call for debugging
explain colors and stuff possibly and the avg view
favicon
way to get wider time views / some sort of customizability on # days
check for duplicate names
