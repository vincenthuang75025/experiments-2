# Attempt 2 at Experiments

# TODO: 


favicon
site title
antd header

convert components to func
set error msg to red
edit app and skeleton
check for duplicate names

displaying goals + progress + summary
adding a new day + notes. rly should be mouse-free
create public and private per user
create feed

think about security - give each user 2 ids? 
logged out screens
restrict to daily input
maybe redirect screen to progress after submission
make userid, googleid consistent

add names and descs lmao
grid view and line graphs
some way to deprecate goals
